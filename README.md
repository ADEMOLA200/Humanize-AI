# Humanize AI

**Humanize AI** is a text rewriting and humanization service that leverages advanced paraphrasing models and customizable rewriting transformations. The goal is to generate text that preserves meaning while making it less detectable as machine-generated by AI detectors. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Paraphrase Service (Python/Flask):**  
   Uses a T5-based paraphrasing model (e.g., `Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws`) to generate a raw paraphrase of the input text.

2. **Rewriting & Humanization Service (Go):**  
   Calls the paraphrase endpoint and optionally applies additional rewriting transformations (such as synonym replacement, sentence structure variation, natural noise insertion, and contextual filler appending) to “humanize” the text.

---

## Features

- **Paraphrasing:**  
  Leverages a pre-trained T5 model to generate paraphrased text that retains the meaning of the original.

- **Customizable Rewriting:**  
  Modify the degree of humanization by tweaking probabilities for various transformations (e.g., synonym replacement, sentence shuffling, natural noise).

- **AI Detector Evasion:**  
  Aim to produce text that is less likely to be flagged by AI detection tools.

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  The system is split into a Flask service for paraphrasing and a Go service for rewriting, making it easy to update or replace individual components.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (for the paraphrase service)  
- **Go 1.22.9+** (for the rewriting service)  
- **Hugging Face Account & Token:**  
  Obtain an HF token and add it to your environment (or a `.env` file).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/ADEMOLA200/Humanize-AI)
cd undetectable-ai
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Hugging Face token:

   ```env
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
   ```

### 3. Run the Paraphrase Service

From the project root or the `DSk/models` folder (depending on your structure):

```bash
python DSk/models/paraphrase_server.py
```

This will start the Flask paraphrase service on port `5001`.

### 4. Build & Run the Go Service

Assuming you have Go installed:

```bash
cd path/to/your/go/service
go build -o rewriting_service
./rewriting_service
```

The Go service (which uses [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)) will expose an HTTP endpoint (e.g., on port `8080`).

## Usage

### API Endpoints

#### Paraphrase Service (Python/Flask)

- **Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:5001/paraphrase`
- **Request Body (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
      "text": "Your text to paraphrase goes here."
  }
  ```

- **Response (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
      "paraphrased": "The generated paraphrased text.",
      "success": true
  }
  ```

#### Rewriting Service (Go)

- **Endpoint:** `POST [http://localhost:8080/your_rewrite_endpoint](http://localhost:8080/rewrite)`  
  (Check your Fiber route configuration in the Go controllers.)

- **Request Body (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
      "text": "Your text to be rewritten/humanized."
  }
  ```

- **Response (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
      "rewritten_text": "The final rewritten (humanized) text.",
      "success": true
  }
  ```

### Example Workflow

1. Submit a text block to the Go rewriting service.
2. The Go service calls the Python paraphrase endpoint.
3. The Python service returns a raw paraphrase.
4. The Go service optionally applies additional rewriting transformations.
5. The final, humanized text is returned to the user.

---

## Configuration & Customization

The Go rewriting service’s behavior is controlled by probability values in the `RewriteText` function. For example:

```go
// Increase the probability for varying sentence structure from 10% to 30%
if rand.Float64() < 0.3 {
    sent = varySentenceStructure(sent)
}
```

You can adjust the following probabilities:
- **Sentence Structure Variation**  
- **Synonym Replacement**  
- **Natural Noise Addition**  
- **Sentence Shuffling**  
- **Contextual Filler Appending**

Modify these values in the `services` package to achieve the desired level of transformation.
